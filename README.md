# FE test

Hello and welcome!

Thanks for trying this test. Here are a few things we hope you could try:

- Add pagination (of whatever kind, infinite scrolling or button click), or
- Enhance the styling by replacing avatar cards with Material UI cards, or
- Add unit test to safeguard whatever we have and clean up the code to make it more readable, or
- Anything else you want to try but you can do it within an hour.
